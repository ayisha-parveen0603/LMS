## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

## Setup

### 1. Environment Variables

The `.env` file is already created in the root:

```env
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/lms
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-change-in-production
PORT=5000
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Backend
cd server
npm install

# Frontend
cd ../client
npm install
```

### 3. Seed the Database

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```

This creates:
- **15 demo users** across all roles
- **6 published courses** with complete structure
- **10 knowledge base articles**
- **6 course-specific quizzes** (60 questions total)

#### Demo Login Credentials

All accounts use password: `password123`

**Superadmin:**
- superadmin@company.com

**Admin:**
- admin@company.com
- hr@company.com

**Trainer:**
- john.trainer@company.com
- emily.dev@company.com
- david.cloud@company.com

**Learner:**
- alex.learner@company.com (and 8 others)

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd client
npm run dev
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:5000
